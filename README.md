Once you've cloned the repository:

- set postgres credentials in application.properties
- review spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto in application.properties to verify correct postgres behavior on program exit
- review USAGE.md to learn how to use the API
- uncomment the demo Bean in StarWarsApiApplication.java if you want some data preloaded into the database
- start the api
